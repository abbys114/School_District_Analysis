# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
Due to dishonesty in the reading and math scores of the ninth graders in Thomas High School, we had to rerun the School District Analysis to see how those grades effected the overall analysis.  We replaced the ninth graders reading and math scores at Thomas High School with NaNs to keep the data intact.  Once we completed redoing the analysis we were able to determind the effect it had on the individual school data and district data.
